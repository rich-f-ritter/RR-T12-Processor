# Account Mapping Reference

How `account_map.py` assigns each raw T12 line and each rent-roll charge code to a
standardized RedIQ-style code. This is a **first pass** — the workbook's `T12
Categorized` tab exposes every code in an editable dropdown, and the `OS Summary`
re-rolls live via SUMIFS, so a human can override any debatable line in one place.

The code list and ordering are an **exact** match to RedIQ's Overview template
(13 revenue codes, 19 operating-expense codes, 1 non-operating revenue, 22
non-operating expense). Do not reorder or rename codes — the `OS Summary` tab is
laid out to paste 1:1 into the model's `OS Summary Dump` (A1:Q77).

## The standardized chart of accounts

**Effective Gross Revenue** (rows 7–19): `Rentinc` Rental Income · `OI` Other
Income · `RWS` Rubs Water/Sewage · `RT` Rubs Trash · `RF` Rubs Fees · `park`
Garage/Parking · `CI` Corporate Income · `cable` Cable Income · `ltl` (Loss to
Lease)/Gain to Lease · `vac` Vacancy · `cl` Collection Loss/Bad Debt · `nr`
Non-Revenue Units · `conc` Concessions.

**Operating Expenses** (rows 23–41): `Pay` Payroll · `PB` Payroll Burden · `PBo`
Payroll Bonuses · `adv` Marketing/Advertising · `GA` General & Administrative ·
`turn` Turnover · `inter/exte` R&M Interior/Exterior · `cont` Contract · `Safe`
Life Safety/Elevators · `HAF` HOA Fees · `UT` Utilities Trash · `UWS` Utilities
Water Sewer · `UC` Utilities Common · `UF` Utilities Fees · `mgt` Property
Management Fee · `ins` Insurance · `ret` Real Estate Taxes · `NI` Not Included ·
`site` R&M Site.

**Non-operating** (rarely present in a T12): `dispro` (revenue); and expenses
`rd capx aex ece tird tirw tiae intex prin draw repay othdf ord icd scd entex
pfex purch acqex disex depex onoe`.

`ltl`, `vac`, `conc`, `cl`, `nr` carry **negative** values (they reduce revenue).
Signs come straight from the GL — the rollup is a plain `SUM`, never re-signed.

## How a T12 line gets its code

`categorize_t12_line(name, side, section_hint, acct_number)` runs in this order:

1. **Cross-section overrides** (operators reliably misfile these):
   - *forced-placed / tenant-liability / legal-liability insurance* → **GA** (it is a
     recovery cost, not property insurance — per the underwriting methodology).
   - *uniforms* → **GA** (a supply, even when filed under payroll).

2. **Section-aware family** — `section_hint` is the operator's own native
   subsection label, which the parser tracks. It is normalized loosely so it works
   across Yardi / RealPage / Entrata. Section → family:
   payroll/personnel/compensation→payroll · advertising/marketing→adv ·
   G&A/office→GA · utilities→utilities · maintenance/R&M/turnover→maintenance ·
   management fee→mgt · tax|insurance→taxins · contract→cont · other income→otherinc ·
   rubs/reimbursement/recovery→rubs · concession→conc · rental
   adjustment/vacancy/loss→rentadj · gross potential/rental income→rent · write-off→cl.

3. **Within-family splitters** refine by keyword once the family is known. The ones
   that matter most:
   - **payroll**: bonus/commission/incentive **and** employee-apartment-concession /
     housing-allowance → **PBo**; fica/payroll-tax/health/401/benefit/insurance/
     unemployment/burden → **PB**; everything else (salaries, wages, manager,
     leasing, maintenance, **workers' comp**) → **Pay**.
   - **utilities**: **trash/garbage/refuse/valet → `cont`** (RedIQ files trash hauling
     under Contract, not a utility); water/sewer → `UWS`; billing/transfer/audit/fee →
     `UF`; electric/gas/common/cable/energy → `UC`.
   - **maintenance**: turn/make-ready/carpet/paint/vinyl/resurface/**key/lock** →
     `turn`; landscape/pest/snow/elevator/fire/sprinkler/courtesy patrol/security/
     valet/monitor → `cont`; all other physical R&M → `inter/exte`.
   - **taxins**: insurance → `ins`; tax → `ret`.
   - **otherinc**: **month-to-month / short-term-lease fee → `Rentinc`** (it's a rent
     premium); parking/storage → `park`; water-reimb → `RWS`; trash-reimb/valet-trash →
     `RT`; utility-reimb/rubs → `RF`; cable/bulk → `cable`; corporate-housing → `CI`;
     else `OI`.
   - **rentadj**: non-revenue/down/model/employee unit → `nr`; vacancy → `vac`;
     concession/free rent → `conc`; loss-to-lease → `ltl`; bad debt/collection/skip →
     `cl`; else `vac`.

4. **Pure-keyword fallback** (`REVENUE_RULES` / `EXPENSE_RULES`) only when no section
   is recognized. Last rule is catch-all `OI` (revenue) or `GA` (expense).

### RedIQ quirks worth knowing
- **Trash hauling → `cont`** (Contract), not a utility. Valet-trash *recovery* on the
  income side → `RT`.
- **Workers' comp → `Pay`** (RedIQ keeps it in base payroll, not burden).
- **Employee apartment concession → `PBo`** (a payroll bonus, not a rent concession).
- **Month-to-month / STL fee → `Rentinc`** (pulled up into rental income).
- **Insurance** always splits out of a combined "Taxes & Insurance" line → `ins`.
- **Late Fees**: if the line sits in the *Other Income* section it is revenue → `OI`.
  RedIQ sometimes buckets it to `GA`; the editable column lets you match house style.

## Detailed vs. summary T12
A **detailed** T12 has separate GL lines for concessions, loss-to-lease, RUBS fees,
parking, payroll burden/bonuses, insurance, etc. — the categorizer separates each
into its own code. A **summary** T12 collapses these into parent lines (e.g. "Rental
Income" already net of LtL/concessions; "Taxes & Insurance" as one line). On a summary
T12 the EGR / Opex / NOI subtotals still tie exactly, but codes like `ltl`, `conc`,
`RF`, `park` will read 0 because the detail isn't in the file. **Prefer the most
detailed T12 export available.**

## Rent-roll charge codes
`categorize_charge(name)` → `(code, is_contract_rent, is_recurring)`.
**Contract rent = base Rent + Amenity/premium rent** (the only two `is_contract_rent`
charges). Everything else — parking, RUBS, pet, technology, late fees, application,
admin, insurance/renters-liability — is recurring or one-time **Other Income** and is
flagged accordingly in the `Reconciliation` tab's "In Contract Rent?" column.

## Validation against RedIQ (Canyon Ridge)
- Per-line codes on the **detailed** T12 vs RedIQ's own line-level mapping: **96/97**
  (the single difference is the Late-Fees call above).
- **EGR / Operating Expenses / NOI** reconcile to RedIQ **exactly** (Δ = $0) on the
  matching trailing-12 window.

## Amenity rent → Rental Income (contract rent / AGPR)

"Amenity Rent" (and unit premiums: view/floor/upgrade premiums) maps to **`Rentinc`** and
is treated as **contract rent**, not Other Income. Rationale, verified on the Reconciliation
tab:

- Amenity rent is a recurring, lease-level rent premium tied to the specific unit — it is
  part of what the existing lease pays (the definition of contract rent = AGPR).
- It appears **nowhere else on the T12** (no separate amenity line), so excluding it from
  contract rent would lose it entirely.
- Including it ties the rent roll's contract rent **tighter to the latest-month AGPR**
  (Rentinc + loss-to-lease, annualized). On the test deal, including amenity narrowed the
  gap to T1 AGPR materially vs excluding it.

The Reconciliation tab prints this check (the "T1 AGPR, annualized" tie-out plus an
amenity-verification flag) on every run, so the treatment is re-validated per deal rather
than assumed. Pet rent, parking, and technology/valet packages are **not** contract rent
(they are Other Income / their own codes).

**Amenity *rent* vs amenity *fee* — they are not the same.** The above applies to an amenity
**rent premium** that folds into Rental Income (no separate T12 line). A flat monthly **amenity
fee** is different: operators book it as its **own Other Income line** (e.g. Aura's "Amenities
Income," ~$10/unit/mo), so it is **not** contract rent. The two are easy to confuse by name.
The Reconciliation **"Charge → T12 Placement"** test resolves it empirically — it matches the
charge to the T12 line it actually lands on, so an amenity item that ties to an Other Income
line is correctly excluded from contract rent, while one folded into Rental Income stays in.
Decide by where it lands on the T12, not by the word "amenity."

## New vs renewal (lease-date rule)

Per-unit: **new lease** = lease start date **on or before** move-in date; **renewal** =
lease start **after** move-in. Only new leases are market-tested, so the unit mix's
"last 5 new-lease rents" and the lease-trend new-lease series use new leases only.
